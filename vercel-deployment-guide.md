# Hosting Your Next.js E-commerce Application on Vercel

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Next.js e-commerce application to Vercel, a platform optimized for Next.js deployments.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Your Next.js project pushed to GitHub (https://github.com/shivomv/NextjsEcom.git)
- A Vercel account (free to sign up)
- Your environment variables ready (MongoDB URI, Cloudinary credentials, JWT secret, etc.)

## Step 1: Create a Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" and choose to sign up with GitHub
3. Complete the authentication process

## Step 2: Import Your GitHub Repository

1. From your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
2. Under "Import Git Repository", find and select `shivomv/NextjsEcom`
3. Click "Import"

## Step 3: Configure Project Settings

### Environment Variables

Add all necessary environment variables from your `.env.local` file:

1. Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section
2. Add each variable individually:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_cloudinary_upload_preset
```

### Build and Output Settings

Vercel will automatically detect that your project is a Next.js application and configure these settings for you:

- Build Command: `next build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

## Step 4: Deploy

1. Review all settings
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait for the build and deployment process to complete
   - You can watch the build logs in real-time
   - Vercel will run the build command and deploy your application

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Once deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL (e.g., `nextjsecom.vercel.app`)
2. Click on the URL to visit your deployed application
3. Test key functionality:
   - Browse products and categories
   - User authentication (login/register)
   - Add items to cart
   - Checkout process
   - Admin dashboard (if applicable)

## Step 6: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click on "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider

## Step 7: Configure Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment:

1. Every push to your main branch will trigger a new deployment
2. You can configure branch deployments in the Git settings
3. Preview deployments for pull requests are enabled by default

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Connection Issues

- Ensure your MongoDB connection string is correct
- Make sure your MongoDB instance allows connections from Vercel's IP addresses
- For MongoDB Atlas, you might need to set "Allow Access from Anywhere" in the Network Access settings

### Environment Variable Problems

- Double-check all environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
- Ensure there are no typos or extra spaces
- Remember that environment variables are case-sensitive

### Build Failures

- Check the build logs for specific errors
- Common issues include:
  - Missing dependencies
  - Syntax errors
  - Import/export errors
  - API route issues

### API Routes Not Working

- Ensure your API routes are correctly configured for serverless functions
- Check for any hardcoded URLs that might be pointing to localhost

## Monitoring and Analytics

Vercel provides several tools to monitor your application:

1. **Analytics**: View traffic and performance metrics
2. **Logs**: Check application logs for debugging
3. **Functions**: Monitor serverless function performance

## Conclusion

Your Next.js e-commerce application is now deployed on Vercel! The platform is optimized for Next.js applications and provides a seamless deployment experience with features like continuous deployment, preview deployments, and custom domains.
